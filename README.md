# FastAPI Microservices Test Project

This project is a test example to learn how to develop microservices with FastAPI and make them communicate with each other. The project consists of two microservices:

1. **User Microservice**: Manages user data, including email and password, and includes a basic authentication system.
2. **Product Microservice**: Handles product information for handcrafted items, with fields such as name, price, and quantity.

The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in developing microservices with FastAPI and understanding microservice communication, which is different from monolithic architectures like Django.

## Features

- **User Microservice**:
  - Registration and login functionality
  - Password hashing for secure storage
  - JWT-based authentication

- **Product Microservice**:
  - Product management with necessary fields (e.g., name, price, quantity)
